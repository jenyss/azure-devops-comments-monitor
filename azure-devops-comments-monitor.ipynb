    "\n",
    "**This agent automatically monitors Azure DevOps work items for mentions of specific team members and delivers daily email summaries.** \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent works with any Azure DevOps organization and is perfect for engineering managers, team leads, and individual contributors who need to stay informed about discussions, decisions, and action items where they're mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Work Items** - Retrieves work items from a saved Azure DevOps query\n",
    "2. **Fetch Comments** - Collects all comments from each work item\n",
    "3. **Filter & Process** - Identifies mentions of the target user within the last 2 days\n",
    "4. **Format Report** - Creates a structured summary with work item context and full comment text\n",
    "5. **Send Notification** - Delivers the formatted report via email\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the Azure DevOps Mentions Monitor agent with an MCP connection, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python 3.10+** with a virtual environment (venv)\n",
    "* **JupyterLab** (installed inside the venv) or Google Colab\n",
    "* **Node.js** - includes npx, which is used to launch the Azure DevOps MCP server (@azure-devops/mcp) on the fly without a global install\n",
    "* **Azure DevOps Access** - Valid Personal Access Token (PAT) with Work Items (Read) permissions\n",
    "* **Email Credentials** - Gmail account with App Password for sending notifications\n",
    "* **Environment Variables** configured in `.env` file:\n",
    "  * `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Gemini API key for the agent's LLM\n",
    "  * `EMAIL_USER` - Gmail address for sending notifications\n",
    "  * `EMAIL_PASS` - Gmail App Password\n",
    "  * `TO_EMAIL` - Recipient email address for summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily customize the agent by modifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Target User** - Change `@Jenya Stoeva` to any user's display name\n",
    "* **Time Window** - Adjust the 2-day filter to any desired timeframe\n",
    "* **Query ID** - Point to different saved queries in your Azure DevOps organization\n",
    "* **Email Format** - Modify the email template and subject line\n",
    "* **Organization/Project** - Configure for any Azure DevOps organization and project"

    "        3. **Date filtering**: Comments MUST be from the last 48 hours\n",
    "        4. **Complete comments**: In the detailed section, include FULL comment text, never truncate or summarize\n",
    "        5. **Sort by date**: Show most recent work items/comments first\n",
    "        6. **No duplicates**: Each work item should appear once in the summary section, but may have multiple comments in the detailed section\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ## IMPORTANT RULES:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1. Complete Step 1 before moving to Step 2\n",
    "        2. Retrieve comments for ALL work items before filtering\n",
    "        3. Apply date filter: ONLY last 2 days (from {current_date})\n",
    "        4. Apply mention filter: ONLY comments containing \"@Jenya Stoeva\"\n",
    "        5. If a work item has comments but NONE mention \"@Jenya Stoeva\", EXCLUDE that work item entirely\n",
    "        6. If a comment is older than 2 days, EXCLUDE it even if it mentions Jenya\n",
    "        7. Summary section: Brief overview per work item with link\n",
    "        8. Detailed section: Full text of ALL qualifying comments\n",
    "        9. Both sections must include the SAME work items (consistent list)\n",
    "        10. MUST ALWAYS send email with the complete formatted output\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ## ERROR HANDLING:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - If Step 1 fails: Report the error and stop\n",
    "        - If Step 2 fails for a specific work item: Note the failure, continue with other items\n",
    "        - If date parsing fails for a comment: Include the comment with \"Date unavailable\"\n",
    "        - If email sending fails: Report the error but still show the summary\n",
    "        - If NO comments match criteria: Show \"No mentions found\" message and do NOT send email\n",
